# fastify-node-project

What I learned in this Project : 

1. Fastify : Fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js
2. ESLint :  Find and fix problems in your JavaScript code 
3. Prettier : An opinionated code formatter
4. Jest Test : Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
5. Batect : Batect allows you to define your development tasks (building, running, testing, linting and more) in terms of one or more Docker containers, run those tasks quickly and consistently everywhere, and easily share them with your team.
